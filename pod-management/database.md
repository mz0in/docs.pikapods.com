## Accessing the Pod's Database

Advanced users can directly access the database of certain apps to make small edits or import/export data.

**Enabling Database Access**

1. Navigate to **Pod Settings > Database**.
2. You will find an "Enable Database Access" switch. Toggle it to enable or disable database access, depending on your needs.
3. Enabling it will display a login link and a password.

> This feature may not be available for all apps. Some apps use SQLite databases, which can be accessed using SFTP to retrieve the database file.

**Security Considerations**

For improved security, it's essential to keep the database access feature disabled when you're not actively using it. This helps protect your data and minimize potential security risks.
