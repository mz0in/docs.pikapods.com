# Get Started with PikaPods

**PikaPods** is an open-source app hosting service that makes it easy to find, install, and use open-source software. To begin your journey with PikaPods, follow these steps to create an account and deploy open-source apps effortlessly.

## Create an Account on PikaPods

Creating an account on PikaPods is simple and doesn't require credit card information. You will receive **$5 starting credit** upon registration, which you can use to run and test open-source apps from our library. Here's how to create your account:

1. Click the **Sign Up** button located in the upper right corner of your screen.
2. Fill out the required fields: provide your name, email address, and set a password.
3. Check the box to agree with our privacy policy.
4. Click **Sign Up** to complete the process.

## Deploy an Open-Source App

Once your account is set up, you can start exploring the library of available open-source apps. With **over 60 apps** to choose from, you'll find a brief description of each app to help you make your selection. Here's how to deploy an app using PikaPods:

1. Browse the available apps by clicking on **Available Apps** in the upper menu.
2. When you find the app you want, click on **Run Your Own**.
3. Configure the app by assigning it a nickname and selecting the pod region (EU or US).
4. Under **Resources**, set up your CPU, Memory, and Storage as needed. (Note: you can adjust these settings later)
5. Click **Add Pod** to complete the deployment.

## Change App Settings

You can always customize the settings for each app in your pod's library. Keep in mind that modifying compute resources may affect your monthly cost. Here's how to adjust app settings:

2. You can now edit the name, compute resources, set a [custom domain](/manage/custom-domains), enable [SFTP](/manage/files), and enable [database](/manage/database) access.
